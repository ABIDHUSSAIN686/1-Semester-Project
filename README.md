# 1-Semester-Project
This project is related to the Dodge Em game.
The game should be menu-driven and the following options should be available to the user:
1) Start a new game 
2) See high-scores 
3) Help
4) Exit During the execution of the game, 
the player can press the ‘P’ key to pause the game and see the following menu: 
1) Start a new game 
2) See high-scores 
3) Help 
4) Exit
5) Continue 
The names of the menu items are self-explanatory and should perform the relevant function upon pressing the respective number key. 
In the Help menu, you can show the rules/keys to drive the player car.
